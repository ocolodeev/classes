1. Prime number
Create a function that checks if a number is prime number.
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that are both smaller than 6.

2. Narcissistic number / Armstrong number
Create a function that checks if a number is Narcissistic number and using the function check how many Narcissistic numbers exist within a range (from min=0 to max=1000).
Narcissistic number / Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. E.g. 153 - total number of digits is 3, 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3

3. Palindrome number
Create a function that checks if a number is palindrome (do not use arrays).
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar or the number 10801.

4. Greatest common divisor
Create a function that finds Greatest common divisor for 2 input numbers.
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.

5. Fibonacci number
Create a function that checks if a number is Fibonacci number and using the function check how many Fibonacci numbers exist within a range (from min=0 to max=1000).
Fibonacci numbers called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
